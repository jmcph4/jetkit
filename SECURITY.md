## Security Considerations ##

Jetkit is alpha software and should **not**, under any circumstances, be trusted for mission-critical, life-threatening, or monetarily-sensitive applications. Consider even a small subset of the possible issues that could arise from the use of Jetkit:

 - Total loss of all cryptocurrencies owned by an EOA generated using `ses`, due to
    - Poor entropy
    - Mishandling of private key material
    - Logic bugs
 - Invalidation of any digital signatures produced by `ses` or even by other means using keypairs generated by `ses`

## Audits ##

Jetkit is unaudited.
